# Uncertainty-Preview-Control-Barrier-Function-for-Safety-of-Shoulder-Exoskeleton-Robot-Users
Repository for the neural network training and evaluation used in the paper Uncertainty Preview Control Barrier Function for Safety of Shoulder Exoskeleton Robot Users by Seunghoon Hwang, John Atkins, Tarun Pati, Hyunglae Lee, and Sze Zheng Yong submitted to ICRA 2025.

## Walkthrough
See the Jupyter Notebook training_walkthrough.ipynb for loading the dataset and training the model. stopping_time_model.py holds the dataset class, the class for the model itself, a wrapping class for online inference, and some helper functions for training and evaluating the model. More detailed documentation is currently in progress.
